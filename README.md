# Basic Unity 3D Practice - Epicode Master -- m2-g1-lab

## Project Description

This repository serves as a practical exercise for my **Game Development Master's degree at Epicode**.

The project is a simple 3D scene built in Unity, designed to demonstrate and practice fundamental concepts crucial for any game developer. It focuses on the core building blocks of creating a basic interactive environment.

## Learning Objectives & Demonstrated Skills

This exercise showcases my initial hands-on experience with:

*   **Scene Creation & Setup:** Constructing a basic 3D environment from the ground up.
*   **Hierarchy Management:** Effectively organizing GameObjects within the Unity Editor's Hierarchy to maintain a clean and logical project structure.
*   **Rigidbody Physics:** Implementing and configuring Rigidbody components to introduce physics-based movement, gravity, and collisions.
*   **Material Application:** Creating and applying simple Materials to objects to define their visual appearance (color, shininess, etc.).

## Project Structure

The main scene contains:

*   **A Playground:** A simple plane or series of cubes acting as the ground.
*   **Dynamic Objects:** Primitive shapes (Cubes, Spheres) with Rigidbody components applied, allowing them to interact with physics.
*   **Static Objects:** Obstacles or structures without Rigidbodies to create a more interesting environment for collisions.
*   **Basic Materials:** Different colored materials are applied to objects to distinguish their properties and behavior visually (e.g., a "bouncy" material vs. a "slippery" one).

## How to Use (Unity 2022.3.62f2)

1. Clone this repository.
2. In Unity Hub, create a **new project** using the **same Unity version** (2022.3.62f2), then **close the Editor**.
3. Inside the newly created project folder, delete the existing `Assets/`, `Packages/`, and `ProjectSettings/` folders.
4. Copy the `Assets/`, `Packages/`, and `ProjectSettings/` folders from this repository into the root of your new project (overwrite if prompted).
5. Reopen the project through Unity Hub.
6. Navigate to `Assets/Scenes/Esercizio1 or Esercizio2` (or your main scene).
7. Press **Play** to run the project.

This project is a foundational step in my journey to becoming a proficient Game Developer.
